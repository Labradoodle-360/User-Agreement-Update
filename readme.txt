[size=13pt][b][color=#404040]Brief Summary:[/color][/b][/size]
[hr]
User Agreement Update provides a fully re-written system for both modifying and controlling the user agreement.

Allowing you to force (all|groups|members) to re-accept the user agreement before continuing to browse the forum, with two different modes (strict|relaxed), or the ability to turn off requiring members to re-accept at all.

The interface has a lot of jQuery implemented for the best experience possible, along with CSS3 for some extra styling benefits.

Multilingual support was achieved with some very nice results.
